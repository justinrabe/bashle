# bashle
Attempt at a Wordle game through Bash scripting.
1. Create or find an online 5 letter word database.
2. Game randomly chooses a word from DB
2. Game starts, game asks user to input a 5 letter word
3. Once word is inputted, we check if the word inputted is in DB. If not in DB, throw error message and ask user to input again.
4. Check each letter inputted against the letters in the word. Correct letters in the right spot are outputted in Green, correct letters in incorrect spot outputted in yellow.
5. Game loops 5 times, if user cannot find word, game ends.
